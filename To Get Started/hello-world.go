        Go was used to develop Docker and Kubernetes. 
        Developed by Google engineer Rob Pike who's also known as Unix guru. 
        It's community-led and open source. It's a C-like language. 
        it provides automatic memory management including garbage collection. 
        Go is really fast for it's compiled to machine code.

      //Let's start with a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the screen.
      //Example:
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!") //fmt - format
}

       /*
       This might seem like a lot of code for just a simple output, 
       but we will break it down and explain each of the lines of code 
       and what each statement is responsible for.*/
