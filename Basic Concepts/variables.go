Variables
      //Variables are used to store values.

      //In Go, the var keyword is used to declare variables.
      //For example:
var i int

      //The code above declares a variable named i of type int.
      //int stands for integer and represents whole numbers.

      //We can assign the variable a value and output it:
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var i int = 8
  fmt.Println(i) 
} //output: 8

      //We will learn about the other variable types that Go supports in the next lesson.
